        I am a postgraduate (DPhil) student in the sub-department of Atmospheric Oceanic and Planetary Physics at the University of Oxford. I am passionate about the development of computer software for the purposes of modelling complex physical systems, such as planetary atmospheres.

                Currently in the third year of the 3.5 year DPhil programme in atmospheric physics, supervised by Ray Pierrehumbert. I research the evolution of lava planets, aiming to understand how the physics of these systems shapes their evolution through delicate feedback processes. This work will help us understand the histories of Earth and Venus, as well as observations of rocky exoplanets.

                Using a new radiative-convective atmosphere model 'AGNI', we found that atmospheres on permanent lava worlds can be convectively stable. Absorption features of CO2 and SO2 within emission spectra are associated with mantle redox state. Presented at UKPF Meeting 2025.

                With a new interior-atmosphere modelling framework 'PROTEUS', we simulated the evolution and cooling of primordial terrestrial magma oceans. The greenhouse effect of outgassed atmospheres exerts significant control over magma ocean cooling and crystallisation. Presented at EGU 2024.

                Using a radiative-convective photochemical kinetics model, we found that flares induce observable features in the spectra of sufficiently cool gas giants orbiting M-stars. Presented at Exoclimes VI.

                Spring and Summer 2024 <br/><br/>
                Co-supervision of an undergraduate astronomy bachelor's student. I set out project goals to the student, guided them through the research, including the use of computer simulations and statistical analysis, and provided feedback and assessment of their dissertation at the end of the project.

                Academic years 2023 &mdash; 2025  <br/><br/>
                Demonstrating experiments to undergraduate students at Oxford. The experiments involve calculating various physical constants, and demonstrating known relationships such as Faradayâ€™s Law. Demonstrating in labs has taught me several skills, particularly on providing instructions and constructive feedback.

                I visited two primary schools to engage Year 5 children with workshops on general physics. Introduced a class of 30 to broader concepts, and then worked with groups to conduct small experiments.

                I was involved with the development of gallium nitride micro-LED display technology with the process engineering group. This included operation of plasma etch tools, as well as developing novel methods for colour conversion using quantum dots.
