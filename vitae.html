        My research aims to explain observed (exo)planetary structure, atmospheric composition, and thermodynamic states. This is primarily undertaken through numerical modelling, which can capture a wide range of physics from planet formation up to  the present day.

            <b>Nicholls</b>, Lichtenberg, Chatterjee, Guimond, Pierrehumbert (2026) <br/>
            Accepted in Nature Astronomy, arxiv:<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02656">2507.02656</a> <br/><br/>
            I study the evolution of the super-Earth L&nbsp;98-59&nbsp;d from its formation up to the present day. Including atmospheric escape alongside my real-gas atmosphere structure model, I reproduce JWST observations of its hybrid H2-H2S-SO2 atmosphere.
            These results indicate a volatile-rich and geochemically-reducing birth scenario, inviting a more nuanced classification framework for small planets beyond the 'water world' and 'gas dwarf' paradigms.
            Presented at Exoclimes VII and EPSC-DPS 2025.

        <p class="tab1"><b>Self-limited tidal heating and prolonged magma oceans in the L&nbsp;98-59 system </b></p>
        <p class="tab2">
            <b>Nicholls</b>, Guimond, Hay, Chatterjee, Lichtenberg, Pierrehumbert (2025c) <br/>
            Published in MNRAS, doi:<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/staf1167">10.1093/mnras/staf1167</a>, arxiv:<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03604">2505.03604</a>  <br/><br/>
            Observations of L&nbsp;98-59 indicate that it hosts three planets with large orbital eccentricities. I calculate the tidal heating within these planets self-consistently with outgassing and atmospheric energy transport.
            A robust feedback between tidal heating, radiative cooling, and mantle rheology leads to self-regulation of tidal heating. Tidal heating may allow them remain molten for a long time, and raises the potential for 'tidally supported worlds'.

            Accurate models for the atmospheres of lava planets are critical for understanding their evolution and present states.
            I present a new radiative-convective real-gas atmosphere model for lava planets. This model is designed to be flexible and accurate, allowing for rapid exploration of parameter spaces while including a suite of physical processes.

            Using a new radiative-convective atmosphere model 'AGNI', I found that atmospheres on permanent lava worlds can be convectively stable.

            With a new interior-atmosphere modelling framework 'PROTEUS', I simulated the evolution and cooling of primordial terrestrial magma oceans.
            The greenhouse effect of outgassed atmospheres exerts significant control over magma ocean cooling and crystallisation. Presented at EGU 2024.

            Winter 2024 &mdash; Ongoing <br/>
            I have twice been a reviewer for PSJ, assessing research on atmospheric energy transport. I have also been a reviewer for A&A, for an article on planet formation chemistry.

        <p class="tab2">
            Spring &mdash; Summer 2025, Groningen <br/>
            Following the formation of the Moon, substantial amounts of tidal heat energy may have been dissipated within Earth. This project theoretically tested how such heating influenced early Earth and the onset of habitable conditions. The student used the PROTEUS framework that was largely developed during my PhD, and later worked as a research assistant. Their thesis is in review for publication and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00952">available on arXiv</a>.

        <p class="tab2">
            Spring &mdash; Summer 2024, Groningen <br/>
            This project aimed to test the robustness of the canonical runaway greenhouse effect, considering different secondary atmosphere compositions. We then worked to turn their thesis into a paper, <a href="https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/add69f">published in ApJ</a>.
            I guided the student through the research project, including the use of computer simulations and statistical analysis, and provided feedback and assessment of their dissertation at the end of the project.
