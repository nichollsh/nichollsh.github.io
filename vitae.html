        I am a postgraduate (DPhil) student in the sub-department of Atmospheric Oceanic and Planetary Physics at the University of Oxford. 
        My research aims to explain observed (exo)planetary structure, atmospheric composition, and thermodynamic states. This is primarily undertaken through numerical modelling, which can capture a wide range of physics from planet formation up to  the present day.
        A holistic understanding of planetary evolution is critical for explaining telescope observations of rocky planets, and for providing key context on the origin of life.

                Currently in my final year of the DPhil programme in atmospheric physics, supervised by Ray Pierrehumbert and co-supervised by Tim Lichtenberg. 
                I research the coupled interior-atmosphere evolution of rocky (exo)planets, aiming to understand how the physics of these systems shapes their evolution through delicate feedback processes. This research takes the form of numerical modelling, which is then compared to telescope observations.

                Following our previous paper, we study the evolution of the super-Earth L 98-59 d from its formation up to the present day. Including atmospheric escape alongside a real-gas atmosphere structure model, we are able to reproduce JWST and HST observations of this planet's hybrid H2-H2S atmosphere.
                These models indicate a sub-Neptune origin for this planet, and highlight the need for radiative-convective atmosphere calculations.

                Observations of L 98-59 indicate that it hosts three planets with large orbital eccentricities. We calculate the tidal heating within these planets self-consistently with outgassing and atmospheric energy transport.
                A robust feedback between tidal heating, radiative cooling, and mantle rheology leads to self-regulation of tidal heating. Tidal heating may allow them remain molten for a long time, and raises the potential for 'tidally supported worlds'.

                Using a new radiative-convective atmosphere model 'AGNI', we found that atmospheres on permanent lava worlds can be convectively stable.

                With a new interior-atmosphere modelling framework 'PROTEUS', we simulated the evolution and cooling of primordial terrestrial magma oceans.

                JWST observations of the sub-Neptune K2-18 b have indicated the presence of CO2 and absence of NH3 in its atmosphere. 
                We used models of atmospheric chemistry to assess whether these observations are consistent with an underlying magma ocean, as an alternative to the 'hycean' hypothesis.

                Using a radiative-convective photochemical kinetics model, we found that flares induce observable features in the spectra of sufficiently cool gas giants orbiting M-stars.
