        My research aims to explain observed (exo)planetary structure, atmospheric composition, and thermodynamic states. This is primarily undertaken through numerical modelling, which can capture a wide range of physics from planet formation up to  the present day.
        A holistic understanding of planetary evolution is critical for explaining telescope observations of rocky planets, and for providing key context on the origin of life.

                I study the evolution of the super-Earth L&nbsp;98-59&nbsp;d from its formation up to the present day. Including atmospheric escape alongside my real-gas atmosphere structure model, I reproduce JWST observations of its hybrid H2-H2S-SO2 atmosphere.
                These results indicate a volatile-rich and geochemically-reducing birth scenario, inviting a more nuanced classification framework for small planets beyond the 'water world' and 'gas dwarf' paradigms.

                Observations of L&nbsp;98-59 indicate that it hosts three planets with large orbital eccentricities. I calculate the tidal heating within these planets self-consistently with outgassing and atmospheric energy transport.
                A robust feedback between tidal heating, radiative cooling, and mantle rheology leads to self-regulation of tidal heating. Tidal heating may allow them remain molten for a long time, and raises the potential for 'tidally supported worlds'.

                Accurate models for the atmospheres of lava planets are critical for understanding their evolution and present states.
                I present a new radiative-convective real-gas atmosphere model for lava planets. This model is designed to be flexible and accurate, allowing for rapid exploration of parameter spaces while including a suite of physical processes.

                Using a new radiative-convective atmosphere model 'AGNI', I found that atmospheres on permanent lava worlds can be convectively stable.
