        Tell all the truth but tell it slant<br />
        &mdash; Emily Dickinson
        
        </p>
        <pre>
        Tell all the truth but tell it slant —
        Success in Circuit lies
        Too bright for our infirm Delight
        The Truth's superb surprise
        As Lightning to the Children eased
        With explanation kind
        The Truth must dazzle gradually
        Or every man be blind —
            
        </pre>
