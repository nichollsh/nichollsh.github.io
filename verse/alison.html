        (She looks at her photograph)

        I would like to have known
        My husband's wife, my mother's only daughter.
        A bright girl she was.
        
        Enmeshed in comforting
        Fat, I wonder at her delicate angles.
        Her autocratic knee
        
        Like a Degas dancer's
        Adjusts to the observer with an airy poise
        That now lugs me upstairs
        
        Hardly. Her face, broken
        By nothing sharper than smiles, holds in its smiles
        What I have forgotten.
        
        She knows my father's dead
        And grieves for it, and smiles. she has digested
        Mourning. Her smile shows it.
        
        I, who need reminding
        Every morning, shall never get over what
        i do not remember.
        
        Consistency matters.
        I should like to keep faith with her lack of faith,
        But forget her reasons.
        
        Proud of this younger self,
        I assert her achievements, her A levels,
        Her job with a future.
        
        Poor clever girl! I know,
        For all my damaged brain , something she doesn't:
        I am her future.
        
        A bright girl she was.
            
        </pre>
