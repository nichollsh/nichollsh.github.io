        Two-Headed Calf  <br />

        <pre>
        Tomorrow when the farm boys find this
        freak of nature, they will wrap his body
        in newspaper and carry him to the museum.
        
        But tonight he is alive and in the north
        field with his mother. It is a perfect
        summer evening: the moon rising over
        the orchard, the wind in the grass. And
        as he stares into the sky, there are
        twice as many stars as usual.
