        If I Don't Know<br />
        &mdash; Wendy Cope

        <pre>
        He tells her that the Earth is flat -
        He knows the facts, and that is that.
        In altercations fierce and long
        She tries her best to prove him wrong.
        But he has learned to argue well.
        He calls her arguments unsound
        And often asks her not to yell.
        She cannot win. He stands his ground.
        The planet goes on being round.
