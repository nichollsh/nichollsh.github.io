        There is no Frigate like a Book<br />
        &mdash; Emily Dickinson

        <pre>
        There is no Frigate like a Book
        To take us Lands away
        Nor any Coursers like a Page
        Of prancing Poetry -
        This Traverse may the poorest take
        Without oppress of Toll -
        How frugal is the Chariot
        That bears the Human Soul -
            
            
        </pre>
