        Forever - is composed of Nows -
        'Tis not a different time -
        Except for Infiniteness -
        And Latitude of Home -
        
        From this - experienced Here -
        Remove the Dates - to These -
        Let Months dissolve in further Months -
        And Years - exhale in Years -
        
        Without Debate - or Pause -
        Or Celebrated Days -
        No different Our Years would be
        From Anno Dominies -
            
            
        </pre>
