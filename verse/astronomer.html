        When I Heard the Learn'd Astronomer<br />
        &mdash; Walt Whitman
        
        </p>
        <pre>
        When I heard the learn'd astronomer,
        When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me,
        When I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them,
        When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the lecture-room,
        How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick,
        Till rising and gliding out I wander'd off by myself,
        In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,
        Look'd up in perfect silence at the stars.
        </pre>
