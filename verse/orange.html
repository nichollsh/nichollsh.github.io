        The Orange<br />
        &mdash; Wendy Cope

        <pre>
        At lunchtime I bought a huge orange—
        The size of it made us all laugh.
        I peeled it and shared it with Robert and Dave—
        They got quarters and I had a half.
        
        And that orange, it made me so happy,
        As ordinary things often do
        Just lately. The shopping. A walk in the park.
        This is peace and contentment. It's new.
        
        The rest of the day was quite easy.
        I did all the jobs on my list
        And enjoyed them and had some time over.
        I love you. I'm glad I exist.
