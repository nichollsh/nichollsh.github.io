        Lines Composed in a Wood on a Windy Day<br />
        &mdash; Anne Bront&euml;
        
        </p>
        <pre>
        My soul is awakened, my spirit is soaring
            And carried aloft on the winds of the breeze;
        For above and around me the wild wind is roaring,
            Arousing to rapture the earth and the seas.
        The long withered grass in the sunshine is glancing,
            The bare trees are tossing their branches on high;
        The dead leaves beneath them are merrily dancing,
            The white clouds are scudding across the blue sky.
        I wish I could see how the ocean is lashing
            The foam of its billows to whirlwinds of spray;
        I wish I could see how its proud waves are dashing,
            And hear the wild roar of their thunder to-day!
        </pre>
