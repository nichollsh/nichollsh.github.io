        The Clock of Man <br />
        &mdash; Eric Lomax
        
        </p>
        <pre>
        At the beginning of time the clock struck one  
        Then dropped the dew and the clock struck two  
        From the dew grew a tree and the clock struck three  
        The tree made a door and the clock struck four  
        Man came alive and the clock struck five  
        Count not, waste not the years on the clock  
        Behold I stand at the door and knock.
            
        </pre>
