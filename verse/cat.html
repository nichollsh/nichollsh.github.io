        <pre>
        my cat is sad.

        no one else in his family is a cat
        
        we are all human except for him
        
        he is excluded from most things
        
        and no one tells him why
        
        he just wants to play
        
        and be loved
        
        he looks at us with wonder
        
        and disappointment
        
        he says hello i am a cat what is my existence
        
        what is that / why it and not me / please can you look at me and love me too
        
        can i have some of your food please im sorry i dont like my food so much
        
        do you want to play with my toys? this one is my favourite
        
        do you like me
        
        are we brothers
        
        why didnt i grow up
        
        why am i so small
        
        can you help me be happy
        
        where are you going
            
        </pre>
