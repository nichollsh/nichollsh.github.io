        Oranges<br />
        &mdash; Jean Little

        <pre>
        I peel oranges neatly.
        The sections come apart cleanly, perfectly in my hands.
        
        When Emily peels an orange, she tears holes in it.
        Juice squirts in all directions.
        
        “Kate,” she says, “I don't know how you do it!”
        
        Emily is my best friend.
        I hope she never learns how to peel oranges.
