				<i>Rocky planet atmospheric chemistry</i>  
				<br /><br />

				My current research is focussed on understanding the chemical evolution of the atmospheres of young rocky-planets. The relationship between the interior, the surface, the atmosphere, space is complex and is not something we yet understand the dynamics of. By combining various numerical models together we can trace out the evolution pathways of these planets, which is not only critical for interpreting observations, but can help elucidate their histories.

				<i>Distinguishing Oceans of Water from Magma on Mini-Neptune K2-18b</i>  
				<br /><br />

				Mildly irradiated mini-Neptunes have densities potentially consistent with them hosting substantial liquid-water oceans ("Hycean" planets). The presence of CO2 and simultaneous absence of ammonia (NH3) in their atmospheres has been proposed as a fingerprint of such worlds. JWST observations of K2-18b, the archetypal Hycean, have found the presence of CO2 and the depletion of NH3 to <100 ppm; hence, it has been inferred that this planet may host liquid-water oceans. In contrast, climate modeling suggests that many of these mini-Neptunes, including K2-18b, may likely be too hot to host liquid water. We propose a solution to this discrepancy between observation and climate modeling by investigating the effect of a magma ocean on the atmospheric chemistry of mini-Neptunes. We demonstrate that atmospheric NH3 depletion is a natural consequence of the high solubility of nitrogen species in magma at reducing conditions; precisely the conditions prevailing where a thick hydrogen envelope is in communication with a molten planetary surface. The magma ocean model reproduces the present JWST spectrum of K2-18b to ≲3σ, suggesting this is as credible an explanation for current observations as the planet hosting a liquid-water ocean. Spectral areas that could be used to rule out the magma ocean model include the >4 μm region, where CO2 and CO features dominate: magma ocean models suggest a systematically lower CO2/CO ratio than estimated from free-chemistry retrieval, indicating that deeper observations of this spectral region may be able to distinguish between oceans of liquid water and magma on mini-Neptunes.

				<i> Temperature-chemistry coupling in the evolution of gas giant atmospheres driven by stellar flares</i>  
				<br /><br />

				The effect of enhanced UV irradiation associated with stellar flares on the atmospheric composition and temperature of gas giant exoplanets was investigated. This was done using a 1D radiative-convective-chemical model with self-consistent feedback between the temperature and the non-equilibrium chemistry.
				<br />
				It was found that flare-driven changes to chemical composition and temperature give rise to prolonged trends in evolution across a broad range of pressure levels and species. Allowing feedback between chemistry and temperature plays an important role in establishing the quiescent structure of these atmospheres, and determines their evolution due to flares. It was found that cooler planets are more susceptible to flares than warmer ones, seeing larger changes in composition and temperature, and that temperature-chemistry feedback modifies their evolution.
				<br />
				Long-term exposure to flares changes the transmission spectra of gas giant atmospheres; these changes differed when the temperature structure was allowed to evolve self-consistently with the chemistry. Changes in spectral features due to the effects of flares on these atmospheres can be associated with changes in composition. The effects of flares on the atmospheres of sufficiently cool planets will impact observations made with JWST. It is necessary to use self-consistent models of temperature and chemistry in order to accurately capture the effects of flares on features in the transmission spectra of cooler gas giants, but this depends heavily on the radiation environment of the planet.

			<h3 class="tab1">PROTEUS</h3>
			<p class="tab2">
				<i>Framework for simulating the evolution of young rocky planets</i>  
				<br /><br />

				PROTEUS is a Python framework that simulates the coupled evolution of the atmospheres and interiors of rocky planets. 
				It makes use of various submodules, such as the VULCAN chemical-kinetics code and the SOCRATES radiative-transfer code.

			<h3 class="tab1">ATMO</h3>
			<p class="tab2">
				<i>Radiative-convective photochemical kinetics model for gassy planets.</i>  
				<br /><br />

				ATMO is a 1D model of the atmospheres of gas planets. It can evolve the chemistry of these planets over 
				time using a photochemical kinetics model, as well as solve for equilibrium abundances. The headline 
				feature of ATMO is that it can self-consistently solve for these atmospheres by re-adjusting the 
				temperature profile to radiative-convective equilibrium while integrating the chemistry. The model can
				also generate transmission and emission spectra, and has been extensively used for retrievals. It's written 
				in Fortran 90, and has been adapted for 2D modelling in some contexts.
				<br /><br />

				Note that I did not lead the development of ATMO. My contributions to the code enabled some 
				research, however the majority of the code had already existed for a long time before I came near it.
