			This page summarises my current and past research. While this journey has been continuous, I've tried to
			discretise it into separate projects for easier reading. These projects are listed here in chronological

				<i>Rocky planet atmospheric chemistry</i>  
				<br /><br />

				My current research is focussed on understanding the chemical evolution of the atmospheres of young rocky-planets. The relationship between the interior, the surface, the atmosphere, space is complex and is not something we yet understand the dynamics of. By combining various numerical models together we can trace out the evolution pathways of these planets, which is not only critical for interpreting observations, but can help elucidate their histories.

				<i>Assessment of the role of temperature-chemistry coupling
					in the evolution of gas giant atmospheres driven by stellar
					flares</i>  
				<br /><br />

				The effect of enhanced UV irradiation associated with stellar flares on the atmospheric composition and temperature of gas
				giant exoplanets was investigated. This was done using <a href="#atmo">a 1D radiative-convective-chemical model</a> with self-consistent  
				between the temperature and the non-equilibrium chemistry. <br />
				It was found that flare-driven changes to chemical composition and temperature give rise to prolonged trends in evolution
				across a broad range of pressure levels and species. Allowing feedback between chemistry and temperature plays an important
				role in establishing the quiescent structure of these atmospheres, and determines their evolution due to flares. It was found that
				cooler planets are more susceptible to flares than warmer ones, seeing larger changes in composition and temperature, and that
				temperature-chemistry feedback modifies their evolution. <br />
				Long-term exposure to flares changes the transmission spectra of gas giant atmospheres; these changes differed when the
				temperature structure was allowed to evolve self-consistently with the chemistry. Changes in spectral features due to the effects of
				flares on these atmospheres can be associated with changes in composition. For a sufficiently large number of transits (> 2), the
				effects of flares on the atmospheres of cold planets will impact observations made with JWST. It is necessary to use self-consistent
				models of temperature and chemistry order to accurately capture the effects of flares on features in the transmission spectra of
				cooler gas giants, but this depends heavily on the radiation environment of the planet.

		<h2>Tools and models</h2>

			<!-- PROTEUS -->
			<div id="atmo"></div>
			<h3 class="tab1">PROTEUS</h3>
			<p class="tab2">
				<i>Framework for simulating the evolution of young rocky planets</i>  
				<br /><br />

				PROTEUS is a Python framework that simulates the coupled evolution of the atmospheres and interiors of rocky planets. 
				It makes use of various submodules, such as the VULCAN chemical-kinetics code and the SOCRATES radiative-transfer code.
				<br /><br />

				Note that I do not lead the development of PROTEUS, although I have been significantly involved in its development.

			<h3 class="tab1">ATMO</h3>
			<p class="tab2">
				<i>Radiative-convective photochemical kinetics model for gassy planets.</i>  
				<br /><br />

				ATMO is a 1D model of the atmospheres of gas planets. It can evolve the chemistry of these planets over 
				time using a photochemical kinetics model, as well as solve for equilibrium abundances. The headline 
				feature of ATMO is that it can self-consistently solve for these atmospheres by re-adjusting the 
				temperature profile to radiative-convective equilibrium while integrating the chemistry. The model can
				also generate transmission and emission spectra, and has been extensively used for retrievals. It's written 
				in Fortran 90, and has been adapted for 2D modelling in some contexts.
				<br /><br />

				Note that I did not lead the development of ATMO. My contributions to the code enabled some 
				research, however the majority of the code had already existed for a long time before I came near it.
